# Deployment Framework for BizTalk Azure DevOps release tasks

This extension facilitates the deployment (not build) of BizTalk applications to server(s) with a [private agent](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/concepts/agents/agents) (deployment group members qualify).  It started as a decomposition of the Randy Paulo's monolithic [Install-BizTalkApplication](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Powershell-Script-to-903a99c2) PowerShell script into more granular tasks for greater flexibility and enhanced feedback within the scope of a Azure DevOps pipeline.

The BTDF Deploy/Undeploy tasks require artifacts built using the [Deployment Framework for BizTalk (BTDF)](http://biztalkdeployment.codeplex.com/).  For those unfamiliar, I recommend starting with Thomas F. Abraham's recently published [Deployment Framework for BizTalk Visual Studio extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DeployFxForBizTalkTeam.DeploymentFrameworkforBizTalk).

## Tasks
1. **BTDF Deploy**

   Deployment Framework for BizTalk btdfproj project target: Deploy.

1. **BTDF Undeploy**

   Deployment Framework for BizTalk btdfproj project target: Undeploy.

1. **MSI Install**

   Install *any* MSI using the command msiexec.exe /i [msi file].  Not limited to MSIs built by BTDF.

1. **MSI Uninstall**
    
    Uninstall *any* MSI using the command msiexec.exe /x[InstallGuid].  Not limited to MSIs built by BTDF.

1. **Terminate Suspended**

   Terminate suspended service instances and optionally save the relevant messages and metadata.

   BTDF Undeploy will fail if there are any suspended service instances associated with the BizTalk application being deployed.  This task terminates and (by default) saves the messages and metadata to disk for future reference.

## Typical Usage

   ### For a simple, standalone BizTalk application

   1. Terminate Suspended
       * Save messages checked for production, unchecked for non-production.
   1. BTDF Undeploy
   1. MSI Uninstall
   1. MSI Install
   1. BTDF Deploy

### For BizTalk applications referenced by other BizTalk applications.  (i.e. projects B and C both reference project A)

   1. Terminate Suspended
       * Save messages checked for production, unchecked for non-production.
   1. BTDF Undeploy C
   1. BTDF Undeploy B
   1. BTDF Undeploy A
   1. MSI Uninstall A
   1. MSI Install A
   1. BTDF Deploy A
   1. BTDF Deploy B
   1. BTDF Deploy C

## Multi-Server Deployments

A typical scenario for using these tasks is to define a single task group with
Undeploy, Uninstall, Install and Deploy tasks.

Then use this task group in the deployment stages. 
A typical scenario is to use a deployment group for Non-MgmtDB deployments.
In the following step you use an agent for the MgmtDB deploy.
